## In my project for the creation of the web page I used PHP and JavaScript. For the interactive visualization I used Flash, where I wrote the code in ActionScript. The interactive visualization shows how the surface of cultivated land increases when the proportion of meat in a diet increases. It also shows the percentage of the cultivated land used for feeding the livestock.
